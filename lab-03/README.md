## Project Overview

This lab turns the Lab 2 book routes into a clean REST API built with Node.js, Express.js and SQLite. Endpoint names are nouns (`/books`) and the HTTP method shows the action. The `GET /books/` route supports search, sorting, price-range filtering and pagination through query parameters. The create and update routes validate the request body, and every response uses the correct HTTP status code and a consistent JSON format.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQLite (`sqlite3` and `sqlite` packages)
- Nodemon (development only)
- VS Code REST Client and Postman (testing)

## Project Structure

```text

├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── app.http
├── app.js
├── goodreads.db
├── package.json

```

`node_modules/` is created by `npm install` and is excluded from Git.

## How to Run

**Prerequisites:** Node.js and npm installed.

1. Open a terminal in the `lab-03` folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   For development with auto-restart, use `npm run dev`.

The server runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Required | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`   | No       | Port to listen on. Defaults to `3000`. Hosting platforms like Render set it automatically. |

No other environment variables, secrets or `.env` file are needed.

On first start, the app creates the `book` table in `goodreads.db` and inserts 10 sample books if the table is empty.

## Database Schema

| Column   | Type    | Description                   |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `id`     | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `title`  | TEXT    | Book title                    |
| `author` | TEXT    | Book author                   |
| `price`  | INTEGER | Book price                    |
| `pages`  | INTEGER | Number of pages (optional)    |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path              | Description                                         |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/books/`         | List books with search, filter, sort and pagination |
| GET    | `/books/:bookId/` | Get one book by id                                  |
| POST   | `/books/`         | Add a new book (validated)                          |
| PUT    | `/books/:bookId/` | Update an existing book (validated)                 |
| DELETE | `/books/:bookId/` | Delete a book                                       |

### Query parameters for `GET /books/`

| Parameter   | Default             | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_q`  | empty (matches all) | Partial title match using `LIKE`                               |
| `order_by`  | `id`                | Column to sort by: `id`, `title`, `author`, `price` or `pages` |
| `order`     | `ASC`               | Sort direction: `ASC` or `DESC`                                |
| `limit`     | `10`                | Maximum number of books returned                               |
| `offset`    | `0`                 | Number of books to skip (pagination)                           |
| `min_price` | `0`                 | Minimum price (inclusive)                                      |
| `max_price` | no upper limit      | Maximum price (inclusive)                                      |

Example:

```
GET /books/?search_q=the&min_price=300&max_price=450&order_by=price&order=DESC&limit=5&offset=0
```

### Request body for `POST /books/` and `PUT /books/:bookId/`

```json
{
  "title": "Python Basics",
  "author": "John",
  "price": 350,
  "pages": 250
}
```

Validation rules:

- `title` and `author` are required, non-empty strings.
- `price` is required and must be a non-negative number.
- `pages` is optional, but if provided it must be a positive whole number.

## Status Codes and Response Format

| Situation                                             | Status code                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Successful GET, PUT or DELETE                         | `200 OK`                    |
| Successful POST                                       | `201 Created`               |
| Invalid input (bad body, bad query parameter, bad id) | `400 Bad Request`           |
| Book id or route does not exist                       | `404 Not Found`             |
| Unexpected server or database error                   | `500 Internal Server Error` |

All messages and errors use the same JSON shape:

```json
{ "message": "Book not found" }
```

## Security Notes

- All SQL values use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders). User input is never joined into the SQL string.
- `order_by` and `order` cannot use placeholders, so they are checked against allow-lists (`id`, `title`, `author`, `price`, `pages` and `ASC`, `DESC`) before being used.
- A test with `search_q=';DROP TABLE book;--` returns an empty list and the table is unaffected.

## Test List (Postman / REST Client)

All requests are also saved in [`app.http`](./app.http).

## Debugging Exercise

| Problem           | Error message                                       | Cause                                                                    | Solution                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Port conflict     | `listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000` | Another server (the Lab 2 app) was already running on port 3000          | Stopped the old server with Ctrl + C (or ended the process with `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`), then restarted. Port can also be changed with the `PORT` variable. |
| Wrong import path | `Cannot find module '...'`                          | The `require` path pointed to the wrong file or folder                   | Corrected the relative path (`./` for the same folder, `../` for the parent) and the file name.                                                               |
| Table name typo   | `SQLITE_ERROR: no such table: ...`                  | The SQL query used a table name different from the one in `CREATE TABLE` | Changed the query to use the exact table name `book`.                                                                                                         |
| Missing `await`   | Empty or wrong response, `Promise { <pending> }`    | `db.all()` and `db.run()` return Promises and were not awaited           | Added `await` and made the function `async`.                                                                                                                  |

## Notes: Problems Faced and How I Solved Them

- **Port already in use:** The server failed to start because the Lab 2 server was still running. I added an error callback to `app.listen` so the message is clear, then stopped the old process.
- **Testing in the terminal:** I typed a URL into PowerShell by mistake. URLs go in the browser or REST Client, while the terminal is for commands.
- **Sorting safely:** Column names cannot be passed as `?` parameters, so I used allow-lists for `order_by` and `order` to prevent SQL injection.
- **Consistent errors:** Express returns an HTML page for broken JSON by default. I added an error-handling middleware so even that returns `{ "message": "..." }`.
- **Deployment:** The database file is stored on Render's temporary disk on the free plan, so added books may reset after a restart. The sample data is re-created automatically on startup.

## Learning Outcomes

- Designed REST endpoints using nouns and HTTP methods.
- Used query parameters for search, sorting, filtering and pagination.
- Validated request data and returned correct status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500).
- Used parameterized queries and allow-lists to prevent SQL injection.
- Identified and fixed common errors: `EADDRINUSE`, wrong import path, `no such table` and missing `await`.
- Tested success and failure cases with REST Client and Postman.
